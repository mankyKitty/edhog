# Level 04 - Pre-conditions

We're starting to build up an nice list of commands. So far they have all
separate parts of our model. There are no dependencies so Hedgehog is free to
generate and shrink as it chooses, any sequence of commands is as valid as any
other.

But we need a way to ensure that our commands will only run when it makes sense
to do so. Otherwise we will have commands that execute and fail our tests when
those commands should never have been included to begin with.

We will use the `takeMug` function as an example. If we were to include a
`Command` for this function without an appropriate `Require`, our tests would
pass randomly, only when this command happened to be included in the right
order.

However if we expanded our model to track whether we had added a mug, then we
could prevent the `takeMug` command from being a valid command. Unless our
criteria over a mug being placed was satisified.

The type of drink we have selected is another example of this. If we wanted to
check that the buttons to add milk or sugar were working correctly, then we need
to make sure we have the correct type of drink selected.
